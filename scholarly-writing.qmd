## Scholarly writing

Scholarly articles require much more detail in their front matter than simply a title and an author. Quarto provides a rich set of YAML metadata keys to describe these details. You can copy & paste from this example to your own report.

## Task: Citations

Methods for citations:

-   use the "insert" button

    -   for in-text, you need to select the box (or de-select)

        -   from here you can cite your R packages and other integrated search engines

-   site the reference using `@key`

    -   for in-text, just use the key

    -   for parenthetical, use `[@key]`

1.  Add the citation key for the paper "'My flight arrives at 5 am, can you pick me up?': The gatekeeping burden of the african academic" as an in-text reference to the sentence below

In @tilley2021my, the authors describe how visitors still expect a personal pick-up, despite the availability of taxi services.

2.  Add the citation key for the paper "'The rich will always be able to dispose of their waste': a view from the frontlines of municipal failure in Makhanda, South Africa" as a citation at the end of the sentence below.

Inequality underpins waste management systems, structuring who can or cannot access services [@kalina2023rich].

## Bibliographies

This folder already contains a `references.bib` file. One way of creating and adding to this file is by using the RStudio Visual Editor mode. Another way is by exporting a collection in Zotero reference management tool.
